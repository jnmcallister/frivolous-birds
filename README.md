This is the repository for the game Frenzy Flap, available here: https://silly-goose-video-games.itch.io/frenzy-flap
This game is essentially Flappy Bird with two birds. You may either play as one player controlling both birds, or two players sharing a keyboard.

Note: Proxyrobo and jnmcallister are the same person. I created a new GitHub account part of the way through development.
